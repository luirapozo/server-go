# server-go

Local server that copies files to the client.

**Objectives:**
- [x] Understanding the logic when creating a local server using go
- [x] Learning the basic parts of a server

**NOTE:** the file transfer part is still not working properly. First slice of data seems to be lost on transfer, still trying to figure out why. Transfer seems to be working without problems in *really* small files
